The AeroMavs vehicle, Osiris, was the second competiton-style vehicle launched by our student rocketry team. After the pre-mature parachute ejection of the vehicle AeroNova, we quickly redesigned the electronics and rebuilt the entire rocket in 4 months (minus some scavenged metal parts from AeroNova).
