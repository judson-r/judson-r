Both rockets listed here had for all practicality the same electronics within (one battery was added between MFTV and AeroNova), but vastly different software.

AeroMavs designed and built the 13ft tall rocket AeroNova for the International Rocketry Engineering Competition, or IREC. this was a 4" interior diameter rocket (~4.25" outer) that housed an avionics bay and payload. The avionics bay consisted of a fully custom 3D print that reduced the height of the previous avionics bay by 40%, while still providing more functionality and organization. The pylod consisted of 2 SLA batteries, a Raspberry Pi 4B, Pi HQ Camera, and a high power WiFi card with circularly polarized antennae. The system was designed around RubyFPV (https://rubyfpv.com), but with difficulties arising from the OS, we switched to making our own software. The AeroNova flight did not transmit video as I did not have the time to do much coding at all, the few lines of code that ran the recording were made by another member of AeroMavs. The recording was never achieved due to the rocket prematurely ejection both parachutes while traveling at mach 1.8, and the section of the rocket containing the video system was not recovered.

AeroMavs designed and built the 11ft tall rocket labeled Modified Flight Test Vehicle, or MFTV, to practice new construction techniques and use an old M2500 motor that we had. It was also had a 4" interior diameter, like out competiton vehicles would be.
